Confidence is a very enjoyable state, full of resources and a feeling of balance and with that also comes wisdom and intelligence and resolve because the experience of confidence can give you a great sense of security and confidence also integrates all those other aspects of your life.

Remembering confidence how you first learned confidence and how at first it was difficult but then you found the resources and how you know that feeling and you can  wonder how soon more of that's going to be available.

And as you really experience that I wonder where in your future you're going to want to feel that confidence first

The resources of all these moments can be available now and all those steps to that future moment in time.

and isn't it nice that you can remember to do that in the future now

words are connections to their memories and sounds and thoughts and images that they have

relax, what is it that you'd like to have more of, that sense of clarity of communication that ability to see into things and to speak your truth and know what it is, you know that feeling, and you can let it grow to where it's confident and true for you is it not? and put it in your future where you want it to be so you know when you communicate with people you said what you wanted to say and you were ready and open to take the feedback to go to the next step.

I wonder how soon in your future you'll find yourself in a place where that feeling might really be what you need.

I'm curious to know how quickly you could step into a moment in your future where you'd like to have that

all the moments leading up to that future will be filled in ways that will delight and surprise you.
